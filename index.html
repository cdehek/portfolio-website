        <p>Hello World! My name is Christian Dehek and I was born in Utah. I have 6 other siblings, 3 brothers and 3 sisters. Unfortunatley we are
            a split family as my parents got divorced when I was little. Nonetheless, I love my family with all my heart! I am currently employed 
            at Schreiber Foods as a Casting Operator. That means I get to make cheese all day! As much fun as that sounds, I would like to pursue
            a different career; specifically Web Development! On this page, you can find my current projects as well as completed projects and how to 
            contact me!
        </p>
